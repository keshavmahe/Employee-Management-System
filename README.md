# Employee Management System Backend (Spring Boot)

## Project Description
This project is the backend for an **Employee Management System** built using **Spring Boot**. It provides a RESTful API to manage employee data (e.g., create, update, delete, retrieve employees). The application uses **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions and **MySQL** for persistent storage. It is designed to be scalable, flexible, and can be easily integrated with frontend frameworks like React.js.

The backend ensures efficient API communication, making it suitable for enterprise applications that require smooth and fast interaction with databases.

- **Java**: 11 or later (core language)
- **Spring Boot**: 2.x (for building the backend)
- **Spring Data JPA**: (for database access)
- **MySQL**: (database for storing employee data)
- **Maven**: (dependency management and build automation)
- **Heroku**: (for hosting the backend)
